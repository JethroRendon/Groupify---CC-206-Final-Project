# **Groupify – Academic Group Project Management App**

### **Final Project for CC 206: Application Development and Emerging Technologies**

Groupify is a mobile application designed to streamline student collaboration in academic group projects. Many students rely on separate tools for communication, file sharing, and task tracking, which often leads to fragmented workflows and disorganized project management. Groupify addresses these challenges by providing a unified, student-centered platform that integrates task management, file organization, and group coordination in a single system.

## 🖥 **How to Run the Application**

Before using the mobile app, ensure that the backend is running.

Open your cmd terminal in Visual Studio Code and run:

```bash
cd groupify-backend
npm start
```

Make sure that the mobile application is already running beforehand.
